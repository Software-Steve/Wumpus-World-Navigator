# Wumpus-World-Navigator

A simple agent who attempts to navigate the wumpus world. **In this project the wumpus was not able to move. 
More information on the wumpus world is available here: http://www.cis.temple.edu/~giorgio/cis587/readings/wumpus.shtml


**Some of the navigate.pl file was provided by the professor to be use in conjunction with the created agent.
